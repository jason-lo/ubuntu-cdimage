# Be careful about the values here; in most cases they are passed to
# debian-cd, which will get upset if they contain a space, hence all the
# odd-looking hyphens.  ubuntu-zh_CN and ubuntu-touch-preview are exceptions
# to this, because they do not use debian-cd.
# For projects that use debian-cd, it will construct an ISO9660 volume ID
# as "$(CAPPROJECT) $(DEBVERSION) $(ARCH)", e.g. "Ubuntu 14.10 amd64"; for
# powerpc, $(ARCH) is abbreviated to "ppc".  The volume ID is limited to 32
# characters.  This therefore imposes a limit on the length of project_map
# values of 25 - (length of longest relevant architecture name).
